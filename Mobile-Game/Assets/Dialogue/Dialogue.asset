  - Kaia - Hi there, can I just take a moment of your time?
  - NPC 2 - It will depend on how long you are looking to waste, What do you want?

    I want to know if they are true or just none sense.
  - NPC 2 - Hmmm...Go ahead
  - 'Kaia - I was told that there was a mysterious man with a strong build, he looked
    pissed off roaming around this city. Do you have any idea or who he may be?
